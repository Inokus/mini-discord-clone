    "# Part Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will challenge your understanding of core React concepts and essential patterns. It will also provide an opportunity to strengthen your coding skills and ability to integrate 3rd-party libraries and APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project description\n",
    "\n",
    "You will create a mini discord clone with basic texting functionality using React and Web Sockets. The app will allow users to connect to a server and have real-time chats in public channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Application Feature Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "* User is prompted to enter their name when they open the app. The name is stored in the application, but it is not required to be persisted on page reloads.\n",
    "* Upon connecting, the user can see available text channels.\n",
    "* Users can see other users on the server (both online and offline).\n",
    "* User can send text messages in available text channels.\n",
    "* Users can see messages from other users in text channels.\n",
    "* Messages should display the author, avatar (can be randomly assigned when a user connects), and date/time when the message was sent.\n",
    "* Messaging happens in real time without users having to refresh the app.\n",
    "* Visually, the app should resemble the main parts of Discord's layout, but overall, the app does not need to look exactly the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "* Must use React.\n",
    "* 3rd-party custom React hook usage is not allowed.\n",
    "* For app state management, you may only use React state; external state management (e.g., Redux) is NOT allowed.\n",
    "* Real-time message exchange must be handled using Web Sockets (WS) with `socket.io`. \n",
    "* Use the provided **Project Starter Kit**, which includes the Web Socket chat server and documentation on how to use it in your React application.\n",
    "* It is enough to connect users on the local network (e.g., same computer, multiple browsers, or browser sessions); connection over the internet is not required.\n",
    "* You may use a UI/CSS framework and 3rd-party libraries if they do not solve the chat functionality.\n",
    "* The application will be viewed in production mode (`npm run build` and `npm run preview`). Ensure that your application works in the production mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bonus Challenges (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have fulfilled the requirements and are looking for an extra challenge, you may choose to work on the following additional functionality:\n",
    "* add ability to fully leave the server instead of simply disconnecting (difference is explained in the starter kit README);\n",
    "* add the ability to have private conversations (direct messages) with connected users;\n",
    "* highlight channels that have unread messages. Clicking on a channel marks it as read;\n",
    "* persist the user over page refreshes, automatically reconnecting to the server (WebSocket server already supports it, inspect the code to understand how);\n",
    "* add the ability to pin a message in a channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hints\n",
    "\n",
    "* Make sure to read the included README file in the project starter kit.\n",
    "* You should be able to draw some inspiration on the approach from the hands-on project.\n",
    "* Only focus on the bonus challenges if you are confident that the main requirements have been fulfilled and are happy with the code quality.\n",
    "* The project starter kit as a starting point, so feel free to adjust it to your needs.\n",
    "* You are free to refactor, extend and improve the WebSocket server, if needed. This should only be necessary when working on bonus challenges. Otherwise, no changes to the WebSocket server are required.\n",
    "* In development mode, React is set in [Strict Mode](https://react.dev/reference/react/StrictMode), which will run the Effects twice. Keep that in mind when developing and debugging your application.\n",
    "* You can use the [Online Socket.IO Tester](https://piehost.com/socketio-tester) or a similar tool to interact with the included WebSocket server. \n",
    "* At the very least, you will need to set the username on the socket before establishing connection, e.g., `socket.auth = { username: 'foo' }`. Otherwise the username will default to `anonymous_<random_id>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Starting Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "* üóÑÔ∏è [Project Starter Kit](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-MPs0xZgbGba2llZgb1wmHKS0zoskiYO/view?usp=drive_link) (see the included README for details).\n",
    "* üìñ [How to use socket.io with React](https://socket.io/how-to/use-with-react) (official documentation).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reviewer Role\n",
    "\n",
    "Present your application as if you are presenting it to a potential user who may want to use the app: showcase functionality, discuss ease-of-use, etc. Then, go through the technical aspects of the application if you are communicating with a senior developer, focusing on your program structure and the challenges you encountered.\n",
    "\n",
    "During a project review, you may get asked questions that test your understanding of covered topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample questions for a reviewer to ask (a reviewer is encouraged and expected to think of more, however!)**:\n",
    "- How does React know when to re-render a component?\n",
    "- What was your thought process for the component composition that you have chosen?\n",
    "- Why is this state necessary in your application?\n",
    "- Can I mutate the DOM in React? What would be valid use cases for it?\n",
    "- Does your application have side effects? What are they, and where?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Evaluation Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Chat functionality:** The application works according to the requirements.\n",
    "* **State management:** React state is used sensibly, purposefully, and only when needed.\n",
    "* **Separation of concerns:** Components are appropriately sized and composed, and the correct code abstractions are chosen.\n",
    "* **Knowledge:** General understanding of sprint topics.\n",
    "* **Live coding:** Ability to explain and adapt the code during the review.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "Read an in-depth guide about reviews here: https://turingcollege.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DLG/pages/537395951/Peer+expert+reviews+corrections\n",
    "\n",
    "**Estimate average time to complete: 25 hours**\n"
